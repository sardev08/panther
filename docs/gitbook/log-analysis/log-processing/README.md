# Log Processing

## Overview

Log analysis can improve visibility into your environments by monitoring events in real time. In this section, we'll show how Panther  gives you the ability to collect and transform logs into meaningful insights.

## How It Works

The following illustration provides a high-level architecture of how Panther aggregates and processes event logs from different sources.

1. Logs are written into an S3 bucket
2. The bucket sends an S3 event notification to an SNS Topic
3. There is an SQS Queue in the Panther Master account that is subscribed to the SNS Topic which receives the event notification
4. A Lambda Function pulls messages off the Queue and assumes an IAM Role to download the new log data
6. A Lambda Function sends the parsed log data to the Log Analysis pipeline

## How to Setup Log Processing

First, **data must send to an S3 bucket.**

We recommend organizing incoming data by using S3 folders or separate buckets. You can onboard as many buckets as you would like from any region.

Then, follow the pages below:
- [Log Processing IAM Setup](iam-setup.md)
- [S3 Event Notifications and SNS Setup](notifications-setup.md)

## Viewing the Logs

Once log processing is setup, your data can be searched with [Historical Search](../../historical-search/README.md)!
