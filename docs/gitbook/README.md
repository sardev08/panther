## Overview

Panther is a cloud-native platform for detecting threats, improving cloud security posture, and powering investigations. Security teams can use Panther for:

|         Use Case         | Description                                                                               |
| :----------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Continuous Monitoring   | Analyze logs in real-time and identify suspicious activity that could indicate a breach   |
|       Alert Triage       | Pivot across all of your security data to understand the full context of an alert         |
|      Searching IOCs      | Quickly search for matches against IOCs using standardized data fields                    |
| Securing Cloud Resources | Identify misconfigurations, achieve compliance, and model security best practices in code |

The diagram below provides a high-level architecture of Panther:

Its three main components are:

* **Log Analysis** to centralize, parse, and analyze log data with Python
* **Cloud Security** to scan AWS accounts, detect misconfigurations, and improve cloud security posture
* **Historical Search** for analytics on collected log data and alerts

The benefits of Panther include:

- Flexible Python-based detections
- Built on serverless technologies for high scale at low cost
- Near real-time analysis for quick alerting and remediation
- Simple deployments using infrastructure as code
- Secure, least-privilege, and encrypted infrastructure deployed within your AWS account
